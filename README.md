# MonocularContactForceEstimation
Detect contact points and estimate forces of hand and object meshes by estimating 3d points from monocular/single-view RGB images.

# Setup
Add distance3d, grasp_metrics and fTetWild to root directory and the HO3D dataset, mano model, ycb model meshes, iknet and kypt_transformer weights to sources as can be seen in https://github.com/shreyashampali/kypt_transformer and https://github.com/CalciferZh/minimal-hand/tree/master
